## About
This website is built for a made up restaurant Kon Ramen. The purpose of this web application is to provide Kon Ramen the ability to receive orders online. It was designed to allow customers to perform the ordering process and receive an order receipt in a few simple steps. Furthermore, an admin user of this application (ie. manager or owner of the restaurant) will have the ability to customize the menu through the application.

Having an online ordering system offers Kon Ramen several benefits:
1. Provide customers an alternative method of submitting their order
2. Provide customers the ability to pre-order their food and pick up their order at their designated pick up time
3. Lower the workload of staff from taking customer orders, hence increase efficiency
4. Allow customers more time to read the menu and finalize their order without the assistance of staff
5. Provide an easier platform for the restaurant owner to customize their menu
6. The application can potentially replace the point of sales (POS) system of the restaurant, which would save an expense for the restaurant
